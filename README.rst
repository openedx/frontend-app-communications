Introduction
------------

A tool used by course teams to communicate with thier learners. The interface for anything related to instructor to learner communications. Instructor bulk email, for example.


Getting started
------------

For now, this repo is not intergrated with devstack. You'll be running the app locally and not through docker. This does make setup a little easier.

1. Clone the repo into your usual workspace

   .. code-block::

      mkdir -p ~/workspace/
      cd ~/workspace/
      git clone https://github.com/edx/devstack.git

2. Install frontend dependencies

   .. code-block::

      npm i

3. start the devserver. The app will be running at `localhost:8585`, or whatever port you change it too.

   .. code-block::

      npm i
